## ðŸ‘¤ About This Repository
This repository is created as a learning resource to explore various **software design principles, programming paradigms, and design patterns**.  
It serves as a structured guide for developers looking to improve their understanding of software architecture and best practices.  

By covering different paradigms like **OOP, Functional, Procedural, and Concurrent Programming**, as well as principles like **SOLID and GRASP**, this repository provides a comprehensive approach to software design.  

The goal is to provide **theory, practical examples, and real-world applications** in multiple programming languages. Contributions and discussions are always welcome! ðŸš€
